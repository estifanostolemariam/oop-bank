# OOP Group Project: Banking Application
Banking demo java project for OOP class.

The Banking and Loan Management System is a desktop application designed to manage banking 
operations and loan processing for clients with multiple user roles. It allows users to securely create 
accounts, deposit and withdraw funds, apply for loans, and manage their financial data. The system 
includes an administrative interface for approving loan applications, viewing user accounts, and 
searching for users. All user and transaction data are persisted in files to ensure that information is 
saved across sessions. The application emphasizes security, input validation, and proper error handling, 
providing a robust and user-friendly experience.
